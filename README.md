# Space Invaders

This is my custom version of the famous **Space Invaders** video game, developed in **C++** for the course **Advanced Programming** during my second year of university.

### About the Project

The objective of this assignment was to create a simple video game engine from scratch in **C++**, and then use it to develop a basic game. I chose to recreate **Space Invaders** as a way to apply the engine and demonstrate the fundamentals of game development.

### Features
- Custom game engine built in C++.
- Recreation of the classic **Space Invaders** gameplay.
- Designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming and game mechanics in C++.

### Technologies
- **C++**
